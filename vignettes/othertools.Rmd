Some comments on using `clustifyr` with other scRNA-seq analysis-augmenting packages

## Feature selection
Using all genes works moderately well, but performance is improved in various testing scenarios by some form of feature selection, such as var.genes in `seurat`, or `M3Drop`, or simply highly variable genes.

## Imputation
Imputation methods such as `ALRA`, in attempt to fill in drop-out signal, are not necessary for cluster-level identity assignment. Per-cell assignment is somewhat improved with imputation. Alternatively, `clustifyr` offers the `rm0` option to treat genes with 0 count as missing instead of low expression, and ignore them.

## Variance stabilizing transformation
`clustifyr` operates on raw counts and log transformed data. VST, such as implemented by `sctransform` is acceptable, but does not appear to give additional benefits. If used, ideally the query and reference matrices should both be transformed.

## Background signal removal
Massive cell death can potentially lead to RNA contamination of all cells sequenced. Assessment of background contamination, and mitigation actions if needed, is important. Building a background reference by averaging all filtered out cell ids would be one simple way.

## Marker gene list selection
Marker genes generated by `seurat` and other methods can be converted to gene list matrix form for `clustify_list`. Somewhat differently, `clustify_nudge` works best with normal feature selection plus a short and nonoverlapping list of markers. Both approaches are handled by settings in `matrixize_markers`.

On a related note, in most cases where the significance of marker RPL or RPS genes is unclear, possibly due to normalization issues, `matrixize_markers` offers a `remove_rp` option. This and similar actions can of course be done manually as well.
